if, if...else, elif(if...elif...elif...elif...else)

if:
The if statement is a conditional statement in python, that is used to determine whether a block of code will be executed or not. 
Which means if the program finds the condition defined in the if statement to be true, it will go ahead and execute the code block inside the if statement.

syntax:
1) if
if condition:
    body

if else:
if statement executes the code block when the condition is true. 
Similarly, the else statement works in conjuncture with the if statement to execute a code block when the defined if condition is false.

2) if else
if condition:
    body
else:
    body

elif:
The elif statement is used to check for multiple conditions and execute the code block within if any of the conditions evaluate to be true.
The elif statement is similar to the else statement in the context that it is optional but unlike the else statement, 
there can be multiple elif statements in a code block following an if statement.

3) elif
 It is used while we have multiple true conditions to perform
 
 if condition:
     body
 elif condition:
     body
 else:
     body
