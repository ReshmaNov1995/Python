Abstraction - Data abstraction is used to hide the low-level details of the programming constructs that define the underlying logic, 
which in turn simplifies and streamlines the development process. 

The main focus of data abstraction is to separate the interface and the implementation of the program.

Process of hiding the internal functionality for the end users.
