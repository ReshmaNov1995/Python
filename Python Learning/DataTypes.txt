Data Types are classes.
Data Types are used to define the type of a variable. It defines what type of data we are going to store in a variable. 

Types of Data Types,
A)Numeric Type:
1)Integers-int
2)Floating point - float
3)Complex Number- complex

B)Text Type:
4)Strings-str

C)Sequence Type:
5)Lists-list
6)Tuples-tup

D)Mapping Type:
7)Dictionaries-dict

E)Set Type:
8)Sets-set


F)Boolean Type:
9)Booleans-bool



list - It is a collection(Ordered) of Objects.Allows duplicate. Mutable.
Ex: ["Reshma",10,20]

set - It is a collection(UnOrdered) of Objects.Doesn't allows duplicate. Mutable.
Ex: {"Reshma",10,20}

dict - It is a collection(Ordered) of Key & Value Pair. Mutable(Changeable).Doesn't allows duplicate.
Ex: {"Name":"Reshma","Age":26,"Father's Name":"SundaraMoorthy}

tup - It is a collection(Ordered) of Objects. It is immutable.Allows duplicate.
Ex: ("Reshma",10,20,"Raju")

DataTypes will be changed as per the values stored in a variable.
Same variables can be stored in different DataTypes.
Ex: x=10
x="Reshma".
This is why Python is Dynamically Typed Programming Language.

Refer immutable.py 
Mutable - Reference by value -> Original value 'll be affected(updated).
It will take the reference variable of original value. If there is any change in the reference variable's value it will affects the original value.
Immutable - Copy by value -> Original value 'll not be affected(updated).
It will take the copy of original value. If there is any change in the copied value it will not affects the original value.
