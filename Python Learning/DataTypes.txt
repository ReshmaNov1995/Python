Data Types are classes.

Types of Data Types,
A)Numeric Type:
1)Integers-int
2)Floating point - float
3)Complex Number- complex

B)Text Type:
4)Strings-str

C)Sequence Type:
5)Lists-list
6)Tuples-tup

D)Mapping Type:
7)Dictionaries-dict

E)Set Type:
8)Sets-set


F)Boolean Type:
9)Boolean-bool



list - It is a collection(Ordered) of Objects.Allows duplicate. Mutable.
Ex: ["Reshma",10,20]

set - It is a collection(UnOrdered) of Objects.Doesn't allows duplicate.
Ex: {"Reshma",10,20}

dict - It is a collection(Ordered) of Key & Value Pair. Mutable(Changeable).Doesn't allows duplicate.
Ex: {"Name":"Reshma","Age":26,"Father's Name":"SundaraMoorthy}

tup - It is a collection(Ordered) of Objects. It is immutable.Allows duplicate.
Ex: ("Reshma",10,20,"Raju")

DataTypes will be changed as per the values stored in a variable.
Same variables can be stored in different DataTypes.
Ex: x=10
x="Reshma".
This is why Python is Dynamically Typed Programming Language.
