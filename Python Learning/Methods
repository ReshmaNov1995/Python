Function and Method is same.

The only difference is a Method is created inside a class and Function is created without/Outside a class.

Instance Method - self is a default argument taken by method which represents the instance of a class. Static Method will consider as a argument alone.

Two Types of Method: Static Method, Class Method, Instance Method

Static Method: It can call directly using class. Also can call through object.
For Static Method - @staticmethod

Class Method: It can call directly using class. Also can call through object.
For Static Method - @classmethod

Instance(Non-Static) Method: It can call only through object. It can't call directly using class.

Note: Static Method can also be accessed using object. But, It will consider self as a parameter.
self is not same for Instance & static Methods.
