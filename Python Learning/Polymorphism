Two Types of Polymorphism:
  Compile time polymorphism(Method overloading, Static Polymorphism, Early binding)
  Run time polymorphism(Method overriding, Dynamic Polymorphism, Late binding)

Method overloading(Compile time polymorphism):
      A class having methods with same name and different parameters.
      Different Parameters either Number of parameters or Type of parameters.
      It is used in a single class.
      It is also used to write the code clarity as well as reduce complexity.
      
Method overriding(Run time polymorphism):
      A class having methods with same name and same parameters. Method declaration will differ.
      It is implemented with Inheritance.
      It is mostly used for memory reducing process.
