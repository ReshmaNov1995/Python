Polymorphism:
      The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types.
      The key difference is the data types and number of arguments used in function.

Two Types of Polymorphism:
  Compile time polymorphism(Method overloading, Static Polymorphism, Early binding)
  Run time polymorphism(Method overriding, Dynamic Polymorphism, Late binding)

Method overloading(Compile time polymorphism):
      A class having methods with same name and different parameters.
      Different Parameters either Number of parameters or Type of parameters.
      It is used in a single class.
      It is also used to write the code clarity as well as reduce complexity.
      
Method overriding(Run time polymorphism):
      A class having methods with same name and same parameters. Method definition will differ.
      It is implemented with Inheritance.
      It is mostly used for memory reducing process.
