Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics(relating to meaning in language). 
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development.

why Python is interpreted?
  Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.

Python Code can Run through IDLE(Python Shell)
Can Run through cmd prompt
Can Run through Notepad/Notepad++

Python is structured and Object Oriented Language.

Why it is said to be Structured?
  Without creating class and object, code can be written.

Object Oriented Programming Structure(OOPS):
  Class
  Objects
  Polymorphism
  Encapsulation
  Inheritance
  Data Abstraction


Numeric, String, Tuple are immutable. Which means it 'll create memory allocation for every updated data.
Ex: a=10 Memory = 59562449; a=100 Memory = 899152.
List, Set, Dictionary are mutable. Which means it 'll not create memory allocation for every updated data. It 'll update the data on the same memory.
Ex: a=10 Memory = 59562449; a=100 Memory = 59562449.
