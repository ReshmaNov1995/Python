Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics(relating to meaning in language). 
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, 
as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
