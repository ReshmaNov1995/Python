1)Why Python is Dynamically typed Programming Language?
No need to define DataType.
Same variable's value can be changed 'n' no.of times.
But, String values can't be changed. 

2)String is mutable or immutable?
  String is immutable.
The String methods won't change the existing string value. It can only reassigned.
 Ex: name="reshma"
 name.upper()
 print(name) # O/P: reshma
 
 FOR INTEGER: 
 a=1
 a+=1
 print(a) # O/P: 2
 Now, a value changed from the existing value. These are mutable.
  
3) Reversal of a String

4) Positional argument must appear before any keyword argument.

5)If Function returns multiple values then it is a tuple(collection).

6)Diff b/w Function & Method,
  Function-> Can create without a class.
  Method-> should create inside a class.
  
7) Diff b/w object based language & object oriented language
object based language - will support only class & Object. Inheritance  will not be supported.
object oriented language - will support class, Object, Inheritance.

8)What is try,except,else and finally in Exception handling?
try can be followed with except, else and finally block.
else block will be executed if the exception has not occurred.
finally block will be executed always.
