The string manipulation function in Python used to break down a bigger string into several smaller strings is called the split() function in Python. 
The split() function returns the strings as a list.

The syntax to define a split() function in Python is as follows:

split(separator, max)

where,

separator represents the delimiter based on which the given string or line is separated
max represents the number of times a given string or a line can be split up. 
The default value of max is -1. In case the max parameter is not specified, the split() function splits the given string or the line whenever a separator is encountered.
