Tuple:
tuple - It is a collection(Ordered) of Objects. It is immutable.Allows duplicate.
Ex: ("Reshma",10,20,"Raju")
Though it is immutable below things are not possible:
  - cannot modify the existing value
  - cannot append and insert
  - cannot remove
Negative index starts from right to left.
1) Creating tuple
2) Accessing items from the tuple
3) Range of Index
4) Change item value - By default tuple does not allow to Add Item bcoz it is immutable. But, there is a workaround.Can achieve using list.
5) Read the tuple item using loop
6) Check if the item is exist in the tuple
7) Tuple length - len()
8) Add Items in the Tuple - By default tuple does not allow to Add Item bcoz it is immutable. But, there is a workaround.Can achieve using list.
9) Copy tuple - tuple(tupletobecopied), variable = tupletobecopied
10) Removing Item from tuple - del keyword
11) Joinning tuple - using + operator
12) Compare tuple - using if
