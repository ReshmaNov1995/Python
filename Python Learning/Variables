Global Variables & Local Variables

Global Variable - Variable which creates outside of the Function.
It can be accessible by both inside & outside.

Local Variable - Variable which creates inside of the Function.
It can be accessible only inside. Can't access outside.
Local variable can be converted to Global by using global keyword. 

Class variable âˆ’ A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. 
Class variables are defined within a class but outside of the methods.
It can be accessed within a method by using self keyword.

Note: If we need variable as a class variable at anywhere, then we should initialise with self keyword like,
      self.a
      If we need variable as a global variable at anywhere, then we should initialise with global keyword like,
      global a
